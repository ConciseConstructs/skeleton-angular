  <h6>Option A: Hourly $40</h6>
  <p>Hours accrue at .5 (half) hour rate.  For example, if a job takes 2.5 hours the accrued fee would amount to $100 USD.</p>

  <h6>Option B: Flat Project Fee:</h6>
  <p>A grand overall fee for developing a project may be agreed upon by both parties.  If so, the project will be set up with predetermined milestones and the portion of the grand fee associated with that milestone.  The Project Commissioner (you) will deposit the agreed-upon amount for that milestone into an escrow account set up and paid for by the Developer (Concise Constructs).  Once the funds have been validated, the Developer (Concise Constructs) will begin the development of that project milestone.  When the milestone is completed the Developer (Concise Constructs) will notify the Project Commissioner (you) and will be able to review the work of the milestone.  If satisfactory, the Project Commissioner (you) will release the funds for that milestone from escrow and will be received by the Developer (Concise Constructs).  If not satisfactory, the Commissioner (you) will submit a list of requested revisions.  This system will repeat until all milestones and therefore the entire project is completed.  At any time if either party does not wish to continue and finish the project either party may terminate the agreement.  Any monies held in escrow and not released to the payee are returned to the original depositor which is the Project Commissioner (you).  Any monies released from escrow to the payee are for services rendered and completion of prior milestones and are non-refundable.  Any fees required by the escrow service will be absorbed by and paid for by the Developer (Concise Constructs).</p>
